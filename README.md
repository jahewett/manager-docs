# User Manual üìñ
This is a user manual (or sorts). It describes how I interact with others and think about the world. This isn't a place for me to make excuses, it's a place for me to be honest. The goal is that whoever is reading this can understand me, how I work and think... and how we can work together.  

### My North Star ‚≠ê 
I care _a lot_ about delivering value and helping the people I work with grow in their careers, and as fellow human beings. 

## Leadership philospy - TLDR (Too Long, Didn't Read) üîç
