# User Manual üìñ
This is my manual. It describes how I interact with others and think about the world. This isn't a place for me to make excuses, it's a place for me to be honest. The goal is that whoever is reading this, can understand me and how I work.  

My North Star ‚≠ê
I care _a lot_ about delivering value and helping the people I work with grow in their careers, and as fellow human beings. 

## TLDR (Too Long, Didn't Read) üîç
My leadership philosphy can be boiled down to _being constantly curious, technically able, with a focus on delivering outcomes and developing people_. 

### What does this mean? üëÄ
- **Curious**: I'm a constant learner, i love to read, listen, ask questions, write, tinker and build. Gaining new skills and knowledge, and honing my existing skills.
- **Technically able**: I stay close to tech and the technical work my teams are doing so i can make decisions and guide. Don't be afraid to get into the technical weeds with me.
- **Outcome focused**: I look to empower my group and teams to deliver results and make decisions, holding them accountable and providing opportunities to grow and take ownership.
- **People focused**: Software is a team sport. I put a high value on building strong working relationships, open and transparent communication and providing coaching, feedback and opportunities to help people grow.
