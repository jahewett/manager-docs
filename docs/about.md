# My philosphy
Wether i am working as an engineer or a leader my philosphoy remains the same...

_**I'm constantly curious, technically able, with a focus on collaboratively delivering outcomes and developing people.**_

### What does this mean? 
- **Curious**: I'm a constant learner, i love to read, listen, ask questions, write, tinker and build. Gaining new skills and knowledge, and honing my existing skills.
- **Technically able**: I stay close to tech and the technical work my teams are doing so i can make decisions and guide. Don't be afraid to get into the technical weeds with me.
- **Outcome focused**: I look to empower my group and teams to deliver results and make decisions, holding them accountable and providing opportunities to grow and take ownership.
- **Developing people**: Software is a team sport. I put a high value on building strong working relationships, open and transparent communication and providing coaching, feedback and opportunities to help people grow.
