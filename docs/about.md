## My philosphy
Wether I am working as an engineer or a leader my philosphoy remains the same...

_**I'm constantly curious, technically able, with a focus on collaboratively delivering outcomes and developing people.**_

### What does this mean? 
- **Curious**: I'm a constant learner, I love to read, listen, ask questions, write, tinker and build. Gaining new skills and knowledge, and honing my existing skills.
- **Technically able**: I stay close to tech and the technical work my teams are doing so I can make decisions and guide. Don't be afraid to get into the technical weeds with me.
- **Outcome focused**: I look to empower my group and teams to deliver results and make decisions, holding them accountable and providing opportunities to take ownership and grow.
- **Developing people**: Software is a team sport. I put a high value on building strong working relationships, open and transparent communication and providing coaching, feedback and opportunities to help people grow. 

## What do i value?
- **Outcomes over outputs**: The best engineers and teams deliver results that make a difference for our customers (see [Outcomes over output]()).
- **Proactive ownership**: I look to build a team of leaders who will proactively identify and own outcomes in their domain (see [Turn The Ship Around](https://candost.blog/books/turn-the-ship-around-summary-book-chapter-notes/)).
- **Learning from "failures"**: Failure is inevitable, when i thappens we acknowlege it, fix it and learn.
- **Domain expertise**: People who know the deep, dark dirty details of their domain are invaluable. 
- **Clear and concise communication (verbal & written)** - Excellent communication in the work place can solve many problems (see [Never Split The Difference]()).
- **Radical candour**: Care personally, regularly challenge directly and provide actionable and specific feedback (see [Radical Candor]()).
- **Listen, don't interrupt**: Give people room to speak. But ask questions, challenge and push if you think something doens't feel right.
- **Decisions and action over extended discussions**: Talk is cheap, cheaper than writing code and fixing bugs. But, we should avoid endless discussion and look to make a decision and take action. Actions _tend_ to be reversible, when they're not we will spend more time talking and look to make the _right_ decision. 
- **Thinking through and tackling edge cases**: This is something I really value in engineers, the ability to identify and tackle edge cases before they become problems is a very valuable skill. At Monzo i learnt the hard ways that, at scale, edge cases can really hurt the business and the product.
- **Organised approach to delivering work**: Process is a tool to deliver outcomes, use it wisely. We're not here to have perfect processes but to deliver value. If something isn't working and we can show, be proactive, own it and fix it.
- **Impact focused time management**: Work never ends, meetings never end. Identify the priorities in your domain, priotise them and organise your calendar so you have focust time to deliver them (see [The Effective Executive](https://medium.com/power-books/the-effective-executive-by-peter-drucker-9b84c62bd94c)).

## Things i'm trying to get better at
Things that i'm currently looking to improve. If you have feedback for me on these things it will be much appreciated.
- **I do too much**: I struggle to turn off and relax. I’m not sure i will ever beat this, it's the weakness behnd being constantly curious. But it's not something i expect of people i work with. I do value a good work/life balance (see link)
- **I pick up too much and sometimes things get dropped**: As a result of the above, in the past i've picked up too much and struggled to deliver it all. I am working on improving how I prioritise and delegate to others.
- **Asking for help**: This has been something i’ve struggled with as i’ve got more senior. I see things as not problems for others and get weighed down by workload and capacity. I'm working on this by improving how I prioritse and delegate.
- **Frustration when people don’t communicate succinctly and directly** - I value making decisions and taking action over long drawn out discussions. There will always be need for discussions but know your audience and tailor the conversation to achieve an outcome. 
- **I’m an introverted extrovert**: I can talk with and interact with groups of people but it wears me down and i need my own time to recharge.
- **Delegating tasks** - Ensuring I know who i'm delegating to, where they are on the [Skill/Will matrix](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/skill-will-matrix-leadership-style), comunicating what i expect as an outcome and agreeing how i support.
